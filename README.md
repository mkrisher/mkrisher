### Hi, hello!

### I'm Michael. Most people call me Mike.

You can read more about me at [mikekrisher.com](http://mikekrisher.com). I've been
in the industry for over two decades. In recent years, I have been focused on
people and process. I ✨still✨ write code but spend a fair amount of time thinking
about how to solve the problems teams experience. I believe the majority of those
problems are due to a lack of proper planning and setting expectations.

### Bio:

In my current role as Director of Engineering at Zyston, I’ve been responsible
for the transition and integration of Blue Lava customers and products into the
Zyston offering post acquisition. I've directly handled the operation and
management of the Blue Lava tenants, supporting customers along the journey,
all the while reducing costs.

As Director of Engineering at Blue Lava, I had the opportunity to help define
our roadmap, strategize on hiring, introduce tools like story mapping and
feature planning, work directly with customers on feature requests, manage the
data platform teams, and implement automation that enabled my teammates to
deliver more efficiently.

Before Blue Lava, I was Director of Engineering at Nike, leading several teams
of over 40 engineers responsible for the transition to real-time data and
analytics. I was asked to streamline several disparate systems into a singular
data platform with real-time capabilities. Under my leadership, the teams
implemented everything from data capture, ingestion, data pipelines, data
warehousing, and machine learning. I focused on hiring and promotion,
introducing roadmaps, budgeting, vendor relationships, establishing support
efforts, and working cross-functionally with many internal stakeholders.

Before joining Nike, I directed the data platform efforts at Recurly with a
core focus on building a high-functioning team. In the process, we introduced
a DevOps culture that was soon adopted by the rest of the organization.

Throughout my 27+ years of experience, I have cultivated a comprehensive skill
set spanning the entire technology stack. I have gained valuable expertise in
various domains from JavaScript, Ruby, and Rust, to APIs and data platforms.
