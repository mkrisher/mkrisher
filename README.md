### Hi, hello!

### I'm Michael. Most people call me Mike. 

You can read more about me at [mikekrisher.com](http://mikekrisher.com). I've been 
in the industry for over two decades. In recent years, I have been focused on 
people and process. I ✨still✨ write code but spend a fair amount of time thinking 
about how to solve the problems teams experience. I believe the majority of those 
problems are due to a lack of proper planning and setting expectations.

### Bio:
In my current role as Director of Engineering at Blue Lava (now Zyston), I’ve had the opportunity 
to help define our roadmap, strategize on hiring, introduce tools like story mapping 
and feature planning, work directly with customers on feature requests, and implement 
automation that enabled my teammates to deliver more efficiently.

Before Blue Lava, I was Director of Engineering at Nike, where I led several teams of 
over 40 engineers responsible for the transition to real-time data and analytics. I was 
asked to streamline a number of disparate systems into a singular data platform with 
real-time capabilities. Under my leadership, the teams implemented everything from 
data capture, ingestion, streaming, warehousing, and machine learning. I focused on 
hiring and promotion, introducing roadmaps, budgeting, vendor relationships, establishing 
support efforts, and working cross-functionally with many internal stakeholders.

Before joining Nike, I directed the data platform efforts at Recurly with a core focus on 
building a high-functioning team. In the process, we introduced a DevOps culture that was 
soon adopted by the rest of the organization.

In my 25+ years of experience, I’ve worked across the full tech stack spanning 
JavaScript, Rails apps, APIs and data platforms. I am genuinely interested in combining my implementation 
experience and acquired managerial skills into being a strategic engineering leader that 
consistently enables teams to deliver.
