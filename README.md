### Hi, 
### hello

### I'm Michael. Most people call me Mike. 

You can read more about me at [mikekrisher.com](http://mikekrisher.com). I've been in the industry 
for over two decades. In recent years, I have been focused on people and process. 
I ✨still✨ write code but spend a fair amount of time thinking about how to 
solve the problems teams experience. I believe the majority of those problems are due to a lack of 
proper planning and setting expectations.

### Bio:
Michael Krisher is a patent awarded engineer and open source contributor with
over two decades of experience leading teams including Nike’s realtime data
platform and Recurly's customer data platform teams. He is a proven leader with the
experience to improve an organization’s process and culture. Whether the
engineering organization was large or small, Michael has made a positive impact
in every team he has had the good fortune to be a part of.
