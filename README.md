### Hi, hello!

### I'm Michael. Most people call me Mike. 

You can read more about me at [mikekrisher.com](http://mikekrisher.com). I've been in the industry 
for over two decades. In recent years, I have been focused on people and processes. 
I ✨still✨ write code but spend a fair amount of time thinking about how to 
solve the problems teams experience. I believe the majority of those problems are due to a lack of 
proper planning and setting expectations.

### Bio:
Michael Krisher is a patent-awarded engineer and open-source contributor with
over two decades of experience leading teams including Nike’s real-time data

expertise to improve an organization’s process, culture, and product. Whether the
engineering organization was large or small, Michael has positively impacted every 
team he has had the good fortune to be a part of.
